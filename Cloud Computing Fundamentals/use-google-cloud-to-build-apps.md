### Compute Services
- Compute engine - IaaS
- App Engine - PaaS
- Cloud functions - Serverless logic
- Google Kubernetes Engine - Hybrid
- Cloud Run - Serverless platform

### Google Compute Engine
- Users can create a VM on GCP
- VM instances are flexible resources which can be created using GCP
- Compute Engine allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) that run different operating systems, including multiple flavors of Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Suse, Red Hat, CoreOS) and Windows Server, on Google infrastructure.

### Autoscaling
- VMs can be added or subtracted depending on the load metrics

### App Engine
- Fully managed serverless platform
- High availability apps without complex architecture

### Cloud functions
- Serverless and event-driven
- Cloud functions are event-driven, they only run when something happens

### GKE
